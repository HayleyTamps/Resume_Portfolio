    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am a highly motivated individual with a passion for coding and
      technology. Over the past two years, I have immersed myself in various
      coding languages, including JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and
      Python, through courses with SheCodes, FreeCodeCamp, and most recently,
      the CodeFirstGirls Full Stack degree. Currently working on Udemy Web
      development course. My background in hairdressing has honed my
      interpersonal and management skills, making me adept at working both
      independently and collaboratively. I am eager to leverage my diverse skill
      set in a challenging role within the tech industry.
